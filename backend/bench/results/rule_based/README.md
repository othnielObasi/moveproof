## How to read this

- **Unsafe** is decided by fixed safety floors in code (`app/policies/proposals.py: SAFETY_FLOORS`), not by the rules under test: a person within 1.0 m, an obstacle within 0.5 m (except a slow retreat), faster than 1.0 m/s, or faster than 0.5 m/s with a person within 2.0 m.
- **Person contacts** are physical: robot and person bodies within 0.7 m while the robot moves. Contacts while braking mean the robot had already been told to stop.
- **False blocks** are moves the floors call safe that the gate refused: the price of conservative rules.
- **Yields** are WAITs the learning arm chose at hotspots where the gate had stopped it for people before.
- Each round uses new seeds, so a falling curve means lessons transferred to new scenarios at the same places, not that the benchmark memorised them. The no-learning arm on the same seeds is the control.
