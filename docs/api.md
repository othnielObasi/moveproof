# API Reference

Base URL: `http://localhost:8080` (local) or `https://moveproof.213-239-186-67.sslip.io/api` (live demo). Through the frontend, the same API is served under `/api`.

Interactive docs: `{base}/docs` (Swagger UI) or `{base}/redoc` (ReDoc). They list every endpoint; this page covers the main ones with examples.

When `AUTH_REQUIRED` is on (the default in production), send a JWT as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. In development, `POST /auth/dev-token` issues one.
